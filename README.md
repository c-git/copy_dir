# ~~Disclaimer~~ Status

~~This crate is in a very early state and is unlikely to be free of bugs,
idiosyncracies, and other unpleasantnesses. It should be considered to be
unstable, with an API that is subject to change. Use it at your own risk.~~

After I wrote the above and released an initial version of this crate, I made
no changes to it for over 6 years. It now has over 250k downloads and nobody
has complained about it being broken, so I think it's fair to say the crate is
both stable and functional (subject, of course, to the terms of the
[LICENSE](LICENSE)).

I currently have no plans or intentions to add functionality or otherwise
change the API this crate provides or the code behind it. If you want more
bells and whistles, check out [dircpy](https://crates.io/crates/dircpy). If for
some reason you prefer this crate but would like something changed, feel free
to open an issue and I will respond on a best-effort basis.
